# BanWindows11
Tool to disable Windows 11 Update for Windows 10.

**Story of me creating this tool:** I had Windows 11 installed of my main PC and it has a lot of bugs and like 5 months of using it, my PC got destroyed by Windows 11. Every program encounters an error also it got Visual Studio corrupted, I got mad at it and installed Windows 10 back again. It started pop-ups to ooh I see you run Windows 10 but Windows 11 is better it destroys your PC want to upgrade? After that, I even bought Windows 10 Pro license to disable it easily.

This tool disables it through the registry. Group Policy support coming soon.
